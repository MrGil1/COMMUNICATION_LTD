# COMMUNICATION_LTD

In this project, I developed a site for a fictional company named COMMUNICATION LTD. 
The web server is designed for agents working in different regions around the globe.
 
Each agent can add clients and search for other clients by name.

The project is built on the Docker platform, with MySQL as the database and Flask as the web framework. 
There are two different versions of the project: one is called 'COMMUNICATION LTD - Secured,' which uses salt and SHA256 encryption,
 and the other is called 'COMMUNICATION LTD - Hacked,' which is unsecured and vulnerable to SQL injection.
